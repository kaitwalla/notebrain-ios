# Crash Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Memory Leaks from Background Tasks**
**Problem**: The app had multiple long-running background tasks that could accumulate over time:
- Summarize polling task running every 5 seconds indefinitely
- Sync timer running every 2 minutes
- Network monitoring staying active

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper error handling and consecutive error counting to the summarize polling task
- Added cleanup of old polling start times to prevent memory accumulation
- Improved task cancellation handling with proper `Task.sleep` error handling
- Added proper cleanup in `onDisappear` to cancel and nil the polling task

### 2. **Core Data Context Issues**
**Problem**: Multiple Core Data operations happening concurrently without proper error handling could cause crashes.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Wrapped Core Data operations in `context.perform` blocks to ensure thread safety
- Added proper error handling with rollback instead of silent failures
- Improved batch operations with better error recovery
- Replaced `fatalError` calls with proper error logging and graceful degradation

### 3. **ArticleActionSyncManager Improvements**
**Problem**: Sync operations could fail silently and accumulate, leading to crashes.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added better error handling in `triggerSync()` method
- Improved `syncActions()` with proper error handling and context management
- Enhanced `cleanupAppliedActions()` with batch operations and error recovery
- Added proper cleanup in `deinit` method

### 4. **CloudKit Settings Manager**
**Problem**: CloudKit operations could fail and cause crashes during settings sync.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Improved `syncToCoreData()` with proper context management
- Added error handling with rollback instead of silent failures
- Better error logging for debugging

### 5. **Article Service**
**Problem**: Article fetching and saving could cause Core Data crashes.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Wrapped all Core Data operations in `context.perform` blocks
- Added proper error handling with rollback
- Improved error propagation instead of silent failures

### 6. **Memory Management**
**Problem**: No memory monitoring or cleanup mechanisms.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created `MemoryManager` class to monitor memory usage
- Added memory warning handling
- Implemented automatic cache clearing on memory warnings
- Added periodic memory usage logging

### 7. **Notification Center Memory Leaks**
**Problem**: Notification observers might not be properly cleaned up.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper observer cleanup in `deinit` methods
- Improved notification handling with weak references

## Key Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Replaced silent failures with proper error logging and recovery
2. **Memory Management**: Added comprehensive memory monitoring and cleanup
3. **Thread Safety**: Ensured all Core Data operations happen on the correct queue
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup in `deinit` methods and `onDisappear`
5. **Crash Prevention**: Replaced `fatalError` calls with graceful error handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Long-running Test**: Keep the app open for extended periods to test memory management
2. **Network Interruption**: Test behavior when network connectivity is lost/restored
3. **Memory Pressure**: Test with memory-intensive operations to trigger memory warnings
4. **Background/Foreground**: Test app behavior when switching between background and foreground

## Monitoring

The app now includes:
- Memory usage logging every 30 seconds
- Error logging for all major operations
- Memory warning handling with automatic cleanup
- Proper resource cleanup on app lifecycle events

These fixes should significantly reduce crashes, especially those related to memory management and Core Data operations that occur after the app has been running for a while.
